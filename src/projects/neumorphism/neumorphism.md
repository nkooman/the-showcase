# Neumorphism

[_Link to project source_](https://github.com/nkooman/the-showcase/tree/master/src/projects/neumorphism)

In this project, I wanted to create the Neumorphism UI mockups I've seen lately. To bring it to life, I used [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) for the animations and [Gradient Path](https://github.com/mnsht/gradient-path) for the complicated SVG gradients. I also spent the time creating simple and subtle CSS animations for various form elements.
