# Grayscale Icons

[_Link to project source_](https://github.com/nkooman/the-showcase/tree/master/src/projects/grayscale-icons)

Grayscale Icons is the first project that I added to The Showcase. I wanted to create a simple and satisfying hover animation for icons. I originally was going to create a separate repository for this project but realized that it would be somewhat cumbersome to constantly spin up new projects everything I want to make a small project. That eventually landing me on the idea of creating a space where I can store them all.
