I have been listening to a lot of city pop lately and wanted to create a page that recreated a similar aesthetic. I made particular use of pastel colors and showcased [Mariya Takeuchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariya_Takeuchi), a well-known Japanese singer-songwriter often regarded as an influential figure in the city pop genre.
