# Depth

[_Link to project source_](https://github.com/nkooman/the-showcase/tree/master/src/projects/depth)

The inspiration for this project was a [post on Reddit from r/typography](https://www.reddit.com/r/typography/comments/ovw2gb/first_time_playing_with_type/). I wanted to recreate the photo with pure CSS. I made great use of the iteration tools available in both [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) and [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) to create this piece. Without them, there would have been _a lot_ of copy and pasting. ðŸ˜¬
